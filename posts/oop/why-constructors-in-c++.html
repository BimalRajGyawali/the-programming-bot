                 <h2>Why Constructors in C++ ?</h2>
                 <span class="dimmed date">October 28,2020</span>
                 <img class="image" src="../../img/why-constructor.jpg" alt="constructor in c plus plus">

                 <p> Have you ever wondered, why constructors are so important in object oriented languages ?
                    Do you, actually know when and how to use the constructors ?
                    Well, in this blog post , we will be focusing on the same thing which is divided into following three points.
                  </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>1) To Construct the objects</li>
                <li> 2) To Impose Forceful Object Construction</li>
                <li> 3) To Stop Object Creation</li>
               
            </ul>
        
        
            <h2 class="section-heading">1. To Construct the objects :</h2>
          <p>In the <a href="../cpp/constructors-in-c++.html">previous</a> post,
             we have discussed that the job of the constructor is to create the objects of a class and return them to the program.
             To set the values to the data members of the objects, we may use public member functions, popularly known as setters as :
         </p>
        
         <p><span class="blue italics">Student.cpp</span>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/2bd84b525ce075e590b604b2e2740885.js"></script>
           </p>
        
           <p>Here setId(), setName() and setMarks() are the setters which set the values of data-members of object.</p>
        
             <p><span class="blue italics">main.cpp</span>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/a99a9ba689c15e3fcde77ef47ff87e36.js"></script><br />
           </p>
            <p class="bold">
                But, what if we want to set the values to data-members of object while it is being created ?</p>
        
                 <p>The answer is quite simple and straight forward, give the values, to be set, to the constructors.
                   It will set the data to the object at the time of creation.</p>
        
            <p>example:</p>
        
            <p> <span class="blue italics">Student.cpp</span>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/e2426d44b5e0d6199ca066d9eab45983.js"></script><br />
           </p>
             <p><span class="blue italics">main.cpp</span>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/293f45a03717e5361491a1be4ac15b5c.js"></script><br/>
           </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">2. To Impose Forceful Object Construction</h2>
                <p>Constructors are important tool if you don't want anyone to create object of a class
                  without setting a particular data member to it. </p>
        
              <p>Let me give an example.</p>
        
           <p>We have Student.cpp class with data-members id, name and marks.
             What if you don't want to let anyone to create an object without setting 'id'?
             Again, the answer is constructor.</p>
        
            <p>Let's implement this in code.</p>
        
         <p>  <span class="blue italics">Student.cpp</span>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/9538652339baa6a0408162a1ed1fa954.js"></script><br />
         </p>
           <p>Here, since there is only one constructor with one integer parameter, we can create object
             only by passing one integer value i.e id , in this case.
             This way, we prevent object creation without setting a particular data-member.</p>
        
         <p class="bold">Note:</p>
        
        
           <p>1) The main thing is, you can create only those types of objects which match the
             constructors signature present in the class.</p>
        
           <p>2) When you don't write any constructor, compiler automatically adds a default one.
             But, if you write at least one constructor, compiler won't add the default
             constructor to your class.</p>
        
        
           <h2 class="section-heading">3. To Stop Object Creation:</h2>
        
            <p>Constructors are also used if you don't want to let the object creation for your class.
              For this, simply make the constructor private (don't include a friend class to your class).</p>
        
           <p>You, probably, be thinking, why would I even create a class if I don't want to allow its
             object creation. Well, out of many, the two important reasons behind not allowing object creation are:
           </p>

         <ul class="list">
            <li> 1) Class is assigned with only functionalities (public static member functions).<br />
            </li>  
            <li>2) Class is implementing Singleton Design Pattern.</li>
         </ul>
    
        
        <p>For this post, we will only see the first condition. We will be discussing the Singleton Design Pattern in future posts.</p>
        
           <p>Let, We have a class named  Operation.cpp
            with the functionalities
             of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
             We don't want its object creation. Let's see how to do it.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="blue italics">Operation.cpp</span>
           <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/518325c9756b4849109ea12e80b4a779.js"></script>
        </p>
            <p>Creating the object of Operation.cpp class will throw you an error,
              unless you take the help of friend class or another public member function. You can try it.</p>
        
            <p>We invoke these methods by the name of the class, without creating objects as:</p>
           <p>
            <span class="blue italics">main.cpp</span>
           <script src="https://gist.github.com/BimalRajGyawali/42942ade8a8c5eb1c5665cfe4727fb41.js"></script>
         </p>
              <p>This way, we have discussed the why, when and how to use constructors in object oriented programming
              language taking the reference of C++.</p>
