                 <h2>API : An Introduction</h2>
                 <span class="dimmed date">October 28,2020</span>
                 <img class="image" src="../../img/api.jpg" alt="picture">
                 <p> API is a regular term used widely in field of web development.
                    But many people don't have any , or have a vague idea about APIs.
                       In this blog post, we will be seeing what exactly are APIs and their significance.</p>
       
       
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What exactly are APIs?</h2>
       
                   <p> Well, APIs stand for Application Programming Interfaces, which allow applications to communicate with one another.
                      Making it simple, API allows one piece of code to talk to another.</p>
       
                  <p>Let me give you an example.</p>
       
              <p> You are developing a web based application, lets say, using PHP.
                 You want to integrate Facebook Login in your application.
                  Here, we want a communication between two different platforms, one is your web application
                  written in PHP and other is Facebook Login Feature build in whatever technology/language.
                  In such situations, we simply get our job done by using APIs provided Facebook.</p>
       
       
         <p> Thus, API acts as a messenger that takes requests from client and returns response from server.
           Don't get yourself confused here. API is not itself a server.
           It simply is a messenger or communicator or interface. Request is done by sending an HTTP request to a server.</p>

          <img class="image" src="../../img/api.png" alt="api">
       
         <p>API is an interface between client and server applications</p>
       
         <h2 class="section-heading">How API allows communication between two different platforms?</h2>
           <p>One of the arguments that is put forward to answer this question is that,
             API deals with universal data formats like JSON and XML, recognized by all platforms.
             That is to say, data returned by API is in JSON or XML formats. Since, XMLs are difficult to work with, JSON is preferred.</p>
       
         <h2 class="section-heading">The classic 'Waiter' example</h2>
           <p>Suppose, you are in a restaurant. You ordered the waiter some food, and
             then the waiter brought you the food from the kitchen.</p>
       
         <p>Taking the analogy here:</p>
       
          <ul class="list">
            <li><span class="blue italics">You</span> are the client.</li>
            <li><span class="blue italics">Kitchen</span> is the server.</li> 
            <li><span class="blue italics">Food</span> is the service you are requesting for.</li>
            <li><span class="blue italics">Waiter</span> is the API.</li>
          </ul>
       
               <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion:</h2>
       
                   <p>API is the interface or communicator which allows the communication between different platforms.
                    In web development, API often refers to the way in which we retrieve information from an online server.
                    API is a messenger which carries request from client application and brings response from server application.
